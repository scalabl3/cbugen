## 1.0 Beta (13 September 2013)

This is the Beta release of Couchbase Lite Android 1.0. 

Couchbase Lite is an ultra-lightweight, reliable, secure JSON database built for all your online and offline mobile application needs. This version features REST APIs, JSON support, and sync capability. 

The beta release is available to all community-edition customers.

### Features

* **REST APIs**—REST APIs provide an alternative access method based on your development needs.

* **Peer-to-peer support via REST APIs**—Communicate with nearby devices, even offline, with our REST API-enabled P2P support.

### Fixes

None.

### Known Issues

* Changes Feed

	* Change Tracker is not using streaming JSON parser for parsing the changes feed for continuous replications.

	Issue: [97](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android/issues/97)

* Document support

	* Saving large documents with REST often returns an HTTP error 400 due to an incorrect check stop in a method. The method checks to see if there is data to be read in the InputStream, rather than checking whether the stream is empty. 
	* Occassional error 400 outputted when attempting to do a PUT

	Issue: [95](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android/issues/95), [99](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android/issues/99)

* Attachment support

	* Updates to documents with attachments are resending attachments even when the attachment data hasn't been updated. This causes performance issues.
