# Database Resources

Database resources provide an interface to an entire database. 
The following table lists the database resources:

|HTTP Method | URI pattern | Description  |
| ------	| ------	| ------	|  
| `PUT`    | `/{db}`                     | Creates a new database
| `GET`    | `/{db}`                     | Retrieves information about a database 
| `DELETE` | `/{db}`                     | Deletes a database 
| `GET`    | `/{db}/_all_docs`           | Retrieve the built-in view of all documents in the database  
| `POST`   | `/{db}/_all_docs`           | Retrieves specified documents from the built-in view of all documents in the database   
| `POST`   | `/{db}/_bulk_docs`          | Inserts multiple documents into the database in a single request
| `GET`    | `/{db}/_changes`            | Returns changes for the database  
| `POST`   | `/{db}/_compact`            | Starts a compaction for the database  
| `POST`   | `/{db}/_purge`              | Purges some historical documents from the database history  
| `POST`   | `/{db}/_temp_view`          | Executes a given view function for all documents and returns the result    |

In the URI patterns, `{db}` represents the name of the database on which you want to operate.

## GET /{db}/_changes
This request retrieves a sorted list of changes made to documents in the database, in time order of application, can be obtained from the database’s _changes resource. Only the most recent change for a given document is guaranteed to be provided. For example if a document has had fields added, and then deleted, an API client checking for changes will not necessarily receive the intermediate state of added documents.

This request can be used to listen for update and modifications to the database for post processing or synchronization. A continuously connected changes feed is a reasonable approach for generating a real-time log for most applications.

## POST /{db}/_compact 
This request compacts the database. Compaction compresses the disk database file by performing the following operations:

* Writes a new, optimized version of the database file. Unused sections are removed from the new version during write. Because a new file is temporarily created for this purpose, up to twice the current storage space of the specified database is required for the compaction routine to complete.

* Removes old revisions of documents from the database, up to the per-database limit specified by the _revs_limit database parameter.

The compaction process runs as a background process.

## POST /{db}/_purge

This request permanently removes references to specified deleted documents from the database. 

Deleting a document does not remove the document from the database— that just marks it as deleted and creates a new revision to ensure that deleted documents can be replicated to other databases as having been deleted. This also means that you can check the status of a document and determine that the document has been deleted by its absence.

Purging documents does not remove the space used by them on disk. To reclaim disk space, run a database compact (see /db/_compact) or compact views (see /db/_compact/design-doc) request.
