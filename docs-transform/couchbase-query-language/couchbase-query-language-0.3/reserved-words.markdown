# Reserved words

The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers. All keywords are case-insensitive.

There will be more reserved words in the future to support DDL, DML, compound statements, and others. To ensure that an identifier does not conflict with a future reserved word, you can escape the identifier with back ticks.
