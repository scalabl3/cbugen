# Ruby â€” Statistics Operations

### Note

The following document is still in production, and is not considered complete or
exhaustive.

The Couchbase Ruby Client Library includes support for obtaining statistic
information from all of the servers defined within a couchbase object. A summary
of the commands is provided below.


```ruby
couchbase.stats
#=> {...}
```

The `stats` command gets the statistics from all of the configured nodes. The information is returned in the form of a nested hash, first containing the address of the configured server and then within each server the individual statistics for that server as key value pairs.


```json
{
    "172.16.16.76:12008"=>
    {
        "threads"=>"4",
        "connection_structures"=>"22",
        "ep_max_txn_size"=>"10000",
          ...
    },
    "172.16.16.76:12000"=>
    {
        "threads"=>"4",
        "connection_structures"=>"447",
        "ep_max_txn_size"=>"10000",
          ...
    },
    ...
}
```
