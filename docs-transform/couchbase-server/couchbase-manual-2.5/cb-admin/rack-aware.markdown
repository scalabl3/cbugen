# Rack Awareness
The Rack Awareness feature allows logical groupings of servers on a cluster where each server 
group physically belongs to a rack or availability zone. This feature provides the ability to 
specify that active and corresponding replica partitions be created on servers that are part of a separate rack or zone. 
To enable Rack Awareness, all servers in a cluster must be upgraded to Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition to use the Rack Awareness feature. 

For more information, see [Managing Rack Awareness](#cb-admin-tasks-rack-aware).

<div class="notebox">
<p>Note</p>
<p>The Rack Awareness feature with its server group capability is an Enterprise Edition feature.</p>
</div>

**Definition list:**

Cluster
: Collection of one or more servers or instances of Couchbase Server that are configured as a logical cluster.

Server (node) 
: A single instance of the Couchbase Server software running on a machine, whether a physical machine, virtual machine, EC2 instance or other environment. 

Server group 
: Logical group of servers in a cluster.

Rack 
: Physical rack where servers in a server group are located.

Availability Zone or Region 
: Cloud servers hosted in locations that are composed of regions and availability zones. Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as availability zones.


**To enable Rack Awareness**

* Configure at least two server groups.
* Configure all of the servers to use server groups.
* Configure each server group to have the same number of servers (recommended).


To improve data availability, configure servers into groups where all of the servers in a server group are in a single rack. With more than one rack, replica partitions of a group are distributed among servers in other server groups. In the event that a whole rack goes down, since the replica partitions are on separate racks, data is available.


<div class="notebox bp"><p>Important</p>
<p>Couchbase does not automatically failover a server group. Auto-failover only fails over one (1) node. Thereafter, the number of auto failover nodes can be reset to zero (0). If a server group is down, the nodes can be manually failed over.
</p></div>


## Replica and replication with server groups
By design, Couchbase Server evenly distributes data of active and replica vBuckets across the cluster for cluster performance and redundancy purposes.

With Rack Awareness, server partitions are laid out so the replica partitions for  servers in one server group are distributed in servers for a second group and vice versa. If one of the servers becomes unavailable or if an entire rack goes down, data is retained since the replicas are available on the second server group.

## Cluster management with server groups
Rack Awareness feature evenly distributes replica vBuckets from one server group to another server group to provide redundancy and data availability.  The rebalance operation evenly distributes the replica vBuckets from one server group to another server group across the cluster. If an imbalance occurs where there is an unequal number of servers in one server group, the rebalance operation performs a "best effort" of evenly distributing the replica vBuckets across the cluster.

### Implementation of replica vBuckets

The following example shows how Rack Awareness functionality implements replica vBuckets to provide redundancy.  In this example, there are two (2) server groups in the cluster and four (4) servers in each server group. Since there is equal number of servers in each server group, the cluster is balanced which guarantees that replica vBuckets for one server group are on a different server group.

The following diagram shows a cluster of servers on two racks, Rack #1 and Rack #2, where each rack has a group of four (4) servers. 

* Group 1 has Servers 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
* Group 1 servers have their active vBuckets and replica vBuckets from Group 2.
* Group 2 has Servers 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
* Group 2 servers have their active vBuckets and replica vBuckets from Group 1.

### Scenario - Adding a server

The following scenario shows how Rack Awareness functionality implements replica vBuckets when an imbalance is caused by an additional server being added to one server group. In this example, an additional server (Server 9) is added to a server group (Group 1). An imbalance occurs because one server group has more servers than the other server group. In this case, the rebalance operation performs a "best effort" of evenly distributing the replica vBuckets of the additional server across the nodes on all the racks in the cluster.


The following diagram shows a cluster of servers on two racks, Rack #1 and Rack #2, where one rack has a group of five (5) servers and the other rack has a group of four (4) servers.

* Group 1 has Servers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9
* Group 1 servers have their active vBuckets and replica vBuckets from Group 2.
* Group 1 Servers 1 - 4 also has replica vBuckets for Server 9.
* Group 2 has Servers 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
* Group 2 servers have their active vBuckets and replica vBuckets from Group 1 including the replica vBuckets from Server 9 in Group 1.

### Scenario - Removing a server or server unavailable

The following scenario shows how Rack Awareness functionality implements replica vBuckets when an imbalance is caused by a server being removed or unavailable in a server group. In this example, a server (Server 2) is unavailable to a server group (Group 1). An imbalance occurs because one server group has fewer servers than the other server group. In this case, if the rebalance operation is performed, a "best effort"  of evenly distributing the replica vBuckets across the cluster occurs.

<div class=notebox>
<p>Note</p>
<p>ï¿¼If the cluster becomes imbalanced, add servers to balance the cluster. For optimal Rack Awareness functionality, a balanced cluster is recommended.</p>
<p>If there is only one server or only one server group, default behavior is automatically implemented, that is, Rack Awareness functionality is disabled.</p>
</div>

The following diagram shows the loss of a server resulting in an imbalance. In this case, Server 2 (from Group 1, Rack #1) becomes unavailable. The replica vBuckets for Server 2 in Group 2, Rack #2 become enabled and rebalancing occurs.

* Group 1 has Servers 1, 2, 3, and 4
* Group 1 servers have their active vBuckets and replica vBuckets from Group 2.
* Group 1 Server 2 becomes unavailable.
* Group 2 has Servers 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
* Group 2 servers have their active vBuckets and replica vBuckets from Group 1.
* Group 2 server activates the replica vBuckets for Server 2 in Group 1.
