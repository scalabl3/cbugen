# Introduction

Welcome to the official Java SDK documentation. The first section, [Getting Started](#getting-started), covers the basic functionality, laying the foundation for the later sections. If you want to see how to build a full-blown application on top of Couchbase, look for the [Tutorial](#tutorial) section next.

The [Using the APIs](#using-the-apis) section holds self-contained reference material about API usage. Go there if you want to dig into topics like storing data, using views and so on. Finally, [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) contains in-depth information about topics that come up during debugging and production.
