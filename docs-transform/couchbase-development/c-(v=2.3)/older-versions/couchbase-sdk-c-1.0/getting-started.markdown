#Introduction

This guide provides information for developers who want to use the Couchbase C SDK to build applications that use Couchbase Server.

# Getting Started

Now that you've installed Couchbase and have probably created a cluster of
Couchbase servers, you will need to use a client library to save and retrieve
data from the cluster. The Couchbase C client library, also known as
libcouchbase, is one way of doing so.

Here's a quick outline of what you'll learn in this chapter:

 * How to obtain the client library.

 * How to build the client library from source (optional).

 * Write a simple program to demonstrate connecting to Couchbase and saving some
   data.

To explore other C SDK methods, please refer to the Couchbase [C SDK Language
reference](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-sdk-c-1.0/index.html).

## Downloading the Couchbase Client Library

Download the latest client library from the [Coucbase download
site](http://files.couchbase.com/developer-previews/clients/couchbase-server-2.0.0-compatible/c/).
It is available as a source archive in both `.zip` and `.tar.gz`

<a id="c-install-linux_and_mac"></a>

## Installing from Source: Linux and Mac OS X

Installation is like many common libraries, following the `./configure`, `make`,
`make install` conventions.

For libvbucket, extract the archive then `cd` into the directory and run:


```
shell> ./configure
shell> make install
```

Standard configure options such as `--prefix` can be passed to the configure
command. Running./configure with --help with provide additional information on
configuration options.

For libcouchbase, extract the archive, then cd into the directory and run:


```
shell> ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/couchbase/include" --disable-couchbasemock
shell> make install
```

The `--disable-couchbasemock` simply disables some tests which are common during
development of libcouchbase, but not required when installing a release.

## Installing from Source: Microsoft Windows

Building and installing on Microsoft Windows depends on `nmake` and tools in
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt, and navigate to the directory for the
extracted archive for libvbucket. The NMakefile defines an `INSTALL` variable as
`C:\local`. Edit the NMakefile if you wish to change the installation location.
Then build and install libvbucket:


```
shell> nmake -f NMakefile install
```

Because it uses memcached binary protocol, libcouchbase requires header files
from the memcached project. After obtaining the memcached source, copy
`memcached.h` and `protocol_binary.h` into `c:\local\include\memcached`.

Then navigate to the directory for libcouchbase. Edit the NMakefile if you wish
to change the installation location, then build and install libcouchbase:


```
shell> nmake -f NMakefile install
```

## Installing on CentOS/ReHat

Installation on CentOS/RedHat Linux consists of adding a set of RPMs.

## Installing on Ubuntu

Installation on Ubuntu Linux consists of adding a set of.deb packages. After
downloading the packages, simply add the packages with the `dpkg` command. There
is a dependent order between the packages, as `libcouchbase` depends on
`libvbucket`.

Also, note that as is common with Ubuntu packaging, the library is broken up
into three separate pieces. One is the library itself. The next is the `-dev`
package which contains header files needed during development. The final package
contains the debug symbols, which may be useful when using a debugger during
development.

The most basic of installs is just a matter of installing `libvbucket1` and
`libcouchbase` with its header files and debug symbols.

```
shell> sudo dpkg -i libvbucket1-1_amd64.deb
shell> sudo dpkg -i libcouchbase1-1_amd64.deb
shell> sudo dpkg -i libcouchbase-dev-1_amd64.deb
shell> sudo dpkg -i libcouchbase1-dbg-1_amd64.deb
```

## Hello C Couchbase

This chapter will get you started with Couchbase Server and the Couchbase C SDK,
`libcouchbase`.

This section assumes you have downloaded and set up a compatible version of
Couchbase Server and have at least one instance of Couchbase Server and one data
bucket established. If you need to set up these items, you can do with the
Couchbase Administrative Console, or Couchbase Command-Line Interface (CLI), or
the Couchbase REST API. For information and instructions, see:

 * [Using the Couchbase Web
   Console](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-1.8/couchbase-introduction.html),
   for information on using the Couchbase Administrative Console,

 * [Couchbase
   CLI](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-1.8/couchbase-admin-web-console.html),
   for the command line interface,

 * [Couchbase REST
   API](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-1.8/couchbase-admin-restapi.html),
   for creating and managing Couchbase resources.

After you have your Couchbase Server set up and you have installed the needed
client libraries, you can compile and run the following basic program.
