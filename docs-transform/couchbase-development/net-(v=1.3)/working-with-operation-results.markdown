# Operation Results and Error Codes

The following sections provide details about working with the `IOperationResult` interface and the error codes it returns.

## Working with operation results


The standard `CouchbaseClient` CRUD operations return `Boolean` values. When
exceptions or failures occur, they are swallowed and `false` is returned.

While there might be scenarios where the cause of a failure is not important
(for example, nonpersistent cache), sometimes you might want to access detailed error information. To that end, `CouchbaseClient` provides a set of complementary ExecuteXXX methods, where XXX is the name of a standard CRUD operation. The following example shows both forms of the method for the `Get` operation:


```
var success = client.Get("foo"); //returns a Boolean

var result = client.ExecuteGet("foo"); //returns an IOperationResult
```

All ExecuteXXX methods return an instance of an implementation of the
`IOperationResult` interface.:


```
public interface IOperationResult
{
    bool Success { get; set; }

    string Message { get; set; }

    Exception Exception { get; set; }

    int? StatusCode { get; set; }

    IOperationResult InnerResult { get; set; }
}
```

For each of the ExecuteXXX methods, a typical use pattern is to interrogate the possible error values on failure, as shown in the following example:


```
var result = client.ExecuteStore(StoreMode.Add, "foo", "bar");

if (! result.Success)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Store operation failed with message {0} and status code {1}", result.Message, result.StatusCode);

    if (result.Exception != null)
    {
        throw result.Exception;
    }
}
```

The `Message` property will contain details as to why an operation failed. The
message might be from the server or it could be from the client. The
`StatusCode` property is a `Nullable<int>` that will be populated from the
server's response.

Note that the 1.1 release of the `OperationResult` API wrapped lower level
(networking) exceptions in an `InnerResult` object. Since release 1.2,
`InnerResult` is no longer populated. The property still remains so as to be
backwards compatible.

Like the standard CRUD methods, the Execute methods will swallow exceptions.
However, caught exceptions are passed back to the caller by way of the
`Exception` property. This allows the caller to check for an exception and throw
it if exception behavior is desired.

There are several interfaces that extend `IOperationResult` to provide
additional properties. Two important interfaces are the
`INullableOperationResult<T>` and `ICasOperationResult`


```
public interface INullableOperationResult<T> : IOperationResult
{
    bool HasValue { get; }
    T Value { get; set; }
}

public interface ICasOperationResult : IOperationResult
{
    ulong Cas { get; set; }
}
```

The `INullableOperationResult<T>` interface is extended by the
`IGetOperationResult`, providing Get operations with properties to get the
retrieved value.


```
var result = client.ExecuteGet("foo");

if (! result.Success)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Get operation failed with message {0} and status code {1}", result.Message, result.StatusCode);

    if (result.Exception != null)
    {
        throw result.Exception;
    }
}

if (result.HasValue)
{
    var value = result.Value;
}
else if (result.StatusCode == 1)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Key does not exist");
}
```

`IGetOperationResult` also extends `ICasOperationResult`. Therefore, it is
possible to get the CAS value from an ExecuteGet operation. The snippet below
demonstrates the generic `ExecuteGet` method.


```
var result = client.ExecuteGet<City>("CT_Hartford");

if (result.Success)
{
    var city = result.Value;
    city.Population = 124775;
    client.ExecuteStore(StoreMode.Set, "CT_Hartford", city, result.Cas); //will fail if Cas is not the same value on server
}
```

`ExecuteStore` methods return `IStoreOperationResult` instances.


```
var result = client.ExecuteStore(StoreMode.Add, "foo", "bar");

if (! result.Success)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Get operation failed with message {0} and status code {1}", result.Message, result.StatusCode);

    if (result.StatusCode == 2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Key already exists");
    }

    if (result.Exception != null)
    {
        throw result.Exception;
    }
}
```

`IStoreOperationResult` also extends `ICasOperationResult`. Therefore, it is
possible to get the CAS value from an ExecuteStore operation.


```
var city = new City() { Name = "Hartford", State = "CT" };
var result = client.ExecuteStore(StoreMode.Add, "CT_Hartford", city);

if (result.Success)
{
    city.Population = 124775;
    client.ExecuteStore(StoreMode.Set, "CT_Hartford", city, result.Cas); //will fail if Cas is not the same value on server
}
```

The `IMutateOperationResult`, `IConcatOperationResult` interfaces also return
the CAS value. These interfaces are returned by
`ExecuteIncrement/ExecuteDecrement` and `ExecuteAppend/ExecutePrepend`
respectively. `IRemoveOperationResult` includes only the properties found in
`IOperationResult`.

## Checking error codes

The Couchbase .NET Client uses the following types of CRUD methods: 

* Methods that return the primitive value of the result (for example,`bool` or `integer`) . The signature of these methods matches the operation's name (for example, Increment(..)).

* Methods that return an `IOperationResult` object. The signature of these methods begins with the prefix "Execute" (for example, ExecuteIncrement).

The benefit of using the methods that return `IOperationResult` is that they give you additional information of about the result of the operation that enables you to handle specific error or failure cases or to determine what caused the error to occur. The most important fields in the `IOperationResult` object are:

 * **Success** - returns Boolean true if operation was successful, otherwise false
 * **StatusCode** - returns an integer value indicating the response status from the server 
 or the IO portion of the client. There is also an enumeration describing the values and 
 extension method that makes the conversion simple. 
 * **Message** - a string describing the error that occurred
 * **Exception** - the exception caused by the error

The following table lists the enumeration name and corresponding numerical value, origin of the value, and description of each `StatusCode`:

|  **Enumeration** |**Value**   |**Origin**   | **Description**  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  Success | 0  | Server  | Operation was successful |
|  KeyNotFound | 1  | Server  | Key was not found on server |
|  KeyExists | 2  | Server  | Key already exists on server |
|  ValueToLarge | 3  | Server  | Value is to large  |
|  InvalidArguments  |  4 | Server  | The operations arguments are invalid  |
|  ItemNotStored | 5  | Server  | The item could not be stored  |
|  IncrDecrOnNonNumericValue | 6  | Server  | An attempt was made to increment or decrement a non-numeric value Â– e.g. a string  |
|  VBucketBelongsToAnotherServer | 7  | Server  | The vBucket the key is mapped to has been changed. Common during rebalance scenarios and operation should be retried  |
|  AuthenticationError | 20  | Server  | SASL authentication has failed. Check the password or user name of the server or bucket  |
|  AuthenticationContinue | 21  | Server  | Used during SASL authentication  |
|  InvalidRange | 22 | Server  | Invalid range was specified  |
|  UnknownCommand | 81 | Server  | Operation was not recognized by server. Should never occur with a Couchbase supported client  |
|  OutOfMemory | 82 | Server  | Server is out of memory. This is usually temporary, but should prompt further investigation  |
|  NotSupported | 83 | Server  | A client attempted an operation that was not supported by the server  |
|  InternalError | 84 | Server  | Server error state  |
|  Busy  | 85 | Server  | Server is temporarily too busy. This may warrant a retry attempt  |
|  TemporaryFailure  | 86 | Server |   |
|  SocketPoolTimeout | 91 | Client | A timeout has occurred while attempting to retrieve a connection. This can happen during rebalance scenarios or during times of high throughput on the client. A retry attempt is warranted in this case |
|  UnableToLocateNode | 92 | Client | Usually a temporary state of the client during rebalance/failover scenarios when a configuration change has occurred (server added or removed from cluster for example). A retry attempt is warranted in this case |
|  NodeShutdown  | 93 | Client | Temporary client state during a configuration change when an operation is using the older state of the cluster. A retry attempt is warranted in this case  |
|  OperationTimeout | 94 | Client | The 1.X client uses synchronous IO, If a connection is terminated by the server a timeout will occur after n seconds on the client if the current operation does not complete. A retry attempt is warranted in this case |

You can find the `StatusCode` enumeration within `Enyim.Caching` assembly: `Enyim.Caching.StatusCode`.
