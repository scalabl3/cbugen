# Command-line Interface for Administration

Couchbase Server includes a number of command-line tools that can be used to
manage and monitor a Couchbase Server cluster or server. Most operations
correspond to Couchbase REST API requests, and were applicable we
cross-reference these REST reqeusts: [REST API for
Administration](#couchbase-admin-restapi).

Couchbase command-line tools are described individually within the following
sections:

Couchbase Server installer places tools in a number of directories, dependent on
the tool and platform. You can either go to that directory and use the command
line tool, or create a symbolic link to the directory:

## Command-Line Tools Availability

As of Couchbase Server 1.8.1 GA, the following command-line tools have been
deprecated and replaced with the corresponding tool as noted in the table below.
In Couchbase 1.8 and earlier versions, both sets of tools were available,
although those prefixed with m- or mb- were deprecated:

**Mac OS X** | `/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/couchbase-cli`

This tool provides access to various management operations for Couchbase Server
clusters, nodes and buckets. The basic usage format is:


```
couchbase-cli COMMAND CLUSTER [OPTIONS]
```

Where:

 * `COMMAND` is a command from [](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-couchbase-commands)

 * `CLUSTER` is a cluster specification. You can use either:

    ```
    --cluster=HOST[:PORT]
    ```

   Or the shortened form:

    ```
    -c HOST[:PORT]
    ```

 * `OPTIONS` is zero or more options.

<a id="couchbase-cli-list-servers"></a>

### Listing Servers

To list servers in a cluster you can provide the host:port for any one of the
nodes in the cluster and also provide the `--output=json` option as we do below:


```
shell> couchbase-cli server-list -c 192.168.0.1:8091 -u Administrator -p password --output=json
```

This will return the following information about the cluster as well as nodes in
the cluster:

 * Memory usage, including quotas and consumption for RAM and disk.

 * List of nodes in cluster, including Couchbase Server version, OS, and memory per
   node.

 * List of REST API endpoints for cluster.

 * Failover and alert settings for the cluster.

If you do not provide the `--output=json` option, you will get a response from
the individual node your provided in your command and whether the node is
active.

<a id="couchbase-cli-get-server-info"></a>

### Getting Node Information

To retrieve information about a specified node, provide the host:port for that
particular node:


```
shell> couchbase-cli server-info -c 192.168.0.1:8091 -u Administrator -p password
```

Couchbase Server returns information about the node, including:

 * Whether the node is functioning or not.

 * Memory usage, including allocated memory, memory quota and free memory.

 * Items stored for node, total items, including replica data.

 * CPU utilization for the node.

 * Ports and disk path associated with a node.

 * Availability and uptime for the node.

<a id="couchbase-cli-adding-node"></a>

### Adding Nodes to a Cluster

To a node to a cluster without performing rebalance, you use the `server-add`
command:


```
shell> couchbase-cli server-add -c 192.168.0.1:8091 \
     --server-add=192.168.0.2:8091 -u Administrator -p password
```

To a node to a cluster and then immediately rebalance the cluster, you use the
`rebalance` command with the `--server-add=HOST[:PORT]` option. In the option
provide the host and port for the node you want to add to the cluster:


```
shell> couchbase-cli rebalance -c 192.168.0.1:8091 \
     --server-add=192.168.0.2:8091
```

<a id="couchbase-cli-removing-nodes"></a>

### Removing Nodes from Clusters

To remove a node from the cluster, use the `rebalance` command and specify the
URI for the node you want to remove in the `--server-remove` option:


```
shell> couchbase-cli rebalance -c 10.4.2.4:8091 -u Administrator -p password --server-remove=10.4.2.4:8091
```

Additional servers can be specified by using addition `--server-remove` option.
The operation imediately triggers s rebalance after the nodes have been removd
from the cluster.


```
INFO: rebalancing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
```

<a id="couchbase-cli-rebalancing"></a>

### Rebalancing a Cluster

To remove a node from a cluster and then rebalance the entire cluster, use the
`rebalance` command with the `--server-remove=HOST[:PORT]` option. In the option
specify the host and port for the node you want to remove:


```
shell> couchbase-cli rebalance -c 192.168.0.1:8091 \
     --server-remove=192.168.0.2:8091
```

To remove and add nodes to/from a cluster and then rebalance, use the
`rebalance` command with the `--server-remove=HOST[:PORT]` and
`--server-add=HOST[:PORT]` options:


```
shell> couchbase-cli rebalance -c 192.168.0.1:8091 \
      --server-remove=192.168.0.2 \
      --server-add=192.168.0.4
```

Couchbase Server will remove one node, add another node, and then perform a
cluster rebalance. During the rebalance, you will see status updates from the
server:


```
. METHOD: GET
PARAMS:  {}
ENCODED_PARAMS:
REST CMD: GET /pools/default/rebalanceProgress
response.status: 200
```

To view the status of a cluster rebalance, use the `rebalance-status` command:


```
shell> couchbase-cli rebalance-status -c 10.4.2.6 -u Administrator -p password
```

If the rebalance is in progress without any errors, Couchbase Server will
return:


```
(u'running', None)
```

To stop a current cluster rebalance, use the `rebalance-stop` command:


```
shell> couchbase-cli rebalance-stop -c 192.168.0.1:8091
```

When Couchbase server stops the rebalance, it will return:


```
SUCCESS: rebalance cluster stopped
```

<a id="couchbase-cli-initializing-nodes"></a>

### Initializing Nodes

Initialize a new node on the cluster


```
shell> couchbase-cli cluster-init -c 192.168.0.1:8091 \
      --cluster-init-username=Administrator \
      --cluster-init-password=password \
      --cluster-init-port=8080 \
      --cluster-init-ramsize=8192
```

<a id="couchbase-cli-viewing-buckets"></a>

### Viewing Buckets

To list all buckets in a cluster use the `bucket-list` command. For this
operation, Couchbase Server does not require authentication:


```
shell> couchbase-cli bucket-list -c 192.168.0.1:8091
```

Couchbase Server returns a list of buckets in the cluster, including:

 * The type of bucket, either membase or couchbase bucket.

 * Memory usage for the bucket, included memory quota, memory used, and number of
   replicas for the bucket.

 * What type of authentication is required for a bucket, either none or SASL.

<a id="couchbase-cli-creating-buckets"></a>

### Creating New Buckets

Create a new couchbase bucket with a dedicated port with the `bucket-create`
command and associated bucket options. Note that the minimum size you can
specify is 100MB, and the maximum number of replicas is 3.


```
shell> couchbase-cli bucket-create -c 192.168.0.1:8091 --bucket=test_bucket \
      --bucket-type=couchbase --bucket-port=11222 --bucket-ramsize=200 \
      --bucket-replica=1
```

To create a new memcached bucket with SASL authentication use the
`bucket-create` command and the `--bucket-password=PASSWORD` option:


```
shell> couchbase-cli bucket-create -c 192.168.0.1:8091 --bucket=test_bucket \
      --bucket-type=memcached--bucket-password=password \
      --bucket-ramsize=200
```

To view the status of a cluster rebalance, use the

<a id="couchbase-cli-updating-bucket-properties"></a>

### Updating Bucket Properties

The following is an example demonstration how to modify the port dedicated to a
bucket. In the case of updating bucket properties with `couchbase-cli` you
should provide other existing bucket properties as options, even though you
might not be changing these other properties. This is because the command to
update bucket properties may interpret missing options as meaning the option
should be reset to a default/nothing. We recommend you review the current bucket
properties and provide your new option and existing options that you want to
maintain:


```
shell> couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.0.1:8091 --bucket=test_bucket \
      --bucket-port=11222 --bucket-ramsize=400
```

You cannot change the name of a bucket with `couchbase-cli`, the Couchbase REST
API, or Couchbase Administration Console. You can however delete the bucket and
create a new bucket with the new name and properties of your choice.

<a id="couchbase-cli-deleting-buckets"></a>

### Deleting Buckets

To delete a bucket:

This operation is data destructive. The service makes no attempt to confirm with
the user before removing a bucket. Client applications using this are advised to
check again with the end user, or client application before sending such a
request.


```
shell> couchbase-cli bucket-delete -c 192.168.0.1:8091 --bucket=test_bucket
```

<a id="couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbstats"></a>

## Using cbstats

You can use `cbstats` to access information about individual nodes, and the
buckets associated with the nodes, in a Couchbase cluster. The utility is
located in one of the following directories, depending upon your platform
install:

<a id="table-couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbstats-locs"></a>

**Linux**    | `/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats`                                                       
-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Windows**  | `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbstats.exe`                                
**Mac OS X** | `/Applications/Couchbase \Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbstats`

[You can use this utility to getcouchbase node
statistics](#couchbase-monitoring-nodestats). The general format for using it
is:


```
shell> cbstats HOST:BUCKET_PORT COMMAND [-flags] [bucketname password]
```

For this command, note that host and port are specifically for a bucket, not a
node or cluster. The following describes the command format:

 * `HOST` is the hostname and `BUCKET_PORT` is the dedicated port for the bucket.

 * `COMMAND` is one of the `cbstats` from the commands listed below.

 * `-flags` are one of the optional flags described below.

 * `bucketname` is the name of the Couchbase or memcached bucket.

 * `password` is the for bucket-level authentication.

The following are the possible `cbstats` commands you can use:

<a id="couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbstats-commands"></a>

Command                   | Description                                                                               
--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`all`                     | Provides statistics for a named bucket.

For example, the `cbstats` output can be used with other command-line tools to
sort and filter the data.


```
watch --diff "cbstats \
    ip-10-12-19-81:11210 all | egrep 'item|mem|flusher|ep_queue|bg|eje|resi|warm'"
```

<a id="cbstats-all-bucket-info"></a>

### Retrieving Bucket Statistics

Use the `all` command to get information about a named bucket:


```
./cbstats 10.4.2.5:11220 all newbucket password | grep -E 'uptime|bytes_read|bytes_written'
```

The types of bucket statistics returned by `all` include:

 * Connection information for the bucket including attempted connections,
   rejections and port information.

 * Hits and Misses: hits are the number of requests made for bucket information and
   misses are requests made for keys that cannot be found. Both hit- and miss-
   statistics are grouped by operation.

 * Memory quota and usage.

Couchbase Server will return these statistics about a memcached or Couchbase
bucket. In the case of memcached buckets, statistics about persistence do not
apply and therefore do not appear:

### Viewing Memory Allocations

To view memory allocations, and memory usage for a bucket:

Couchbase Server 1.8 on OSX using different memory allocation than other
platforms, therefore this information is not available.


```
./cbstats 10.4.2.5:11210 allocator -a -b _admin -p _admin
```

<a id="cbstats-timings"></a>

### Viewing Timing for Operations

You may find this information useful for measuring your node and cluster. This
command returns the time required for operations to complete. All times are
provided in milliseconds:


```
./cbstats 10.4.2.5:11210 timings
```

Couchbase Server returns a histogram showing total operations, and then detail
about operations that completed within different time intervals:


```

<a id="couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbflushctl"></a>

## Using cbflushctl

The `cbflushctl` command enables you to control many of the configuration, RAM
and disk parameters of a running cluster.

Changes to the cluster configuration using `cbflushctl` are not retained after a
cluster restart. Any configuration you had set will return to cluster defaults.

You can find this tool at one of the following locations, depending upon your
platform:

<a id="table-couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbflushctl-locs"></a>

**Linux**    | `/opt/couchbase/bin/cbflushctl`                                                       
-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Windows**  | `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbflushctl.exe`                                
**Mac OS X** | `/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbflushctl`

Usage:


```
cbflushctl host:port COMMAND bucket-name bucket-password
```

Where `COMMAND` is one of the following commands:

 * `drain`

   Drain the disk write queue for the specified bucket.

 * `start`

   Enable the disk write queue for the specified bucket (start persistence).

 * `stop`

   Disable the disk write queue for the specified bucket (stop persistence).

 * `evict key`

   Evict the specified key from memory, providing the key has been persisted to
   disk.

 * `set`

   Set the value for a configurable parameter within the persistence system. For
   more information, see [cbflushctlset
   Command](#couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbflushctl-set).

Note that for each command you must specify the bucketname (and bucket password
if configured) to configure the appropriate bucket. If you want to set the
parameter on multiple buckets you must specify each bucket individually.

<a id="couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbflushctl-set"></a>

### cbflushctlset Command

The `set` command configures a specific parameter or value within the
persistence component. This is used to enable or configure specific behavior
within the persistence system, such as disabling the client `flush_all` command
support, or changing the watermarks used when determining keys to be evicted
from RAM after they have been persisted.

 * `bg_fetch_delay`

   Delay before executing a bg fetch (test feature)

 * `chk_max_items`

   Maximum items before creating a new checkpoint

 * `chk_period`

   Duration before creating a new checkpoint

 * `exp_pager_stime`

   Expiry Pager Sleeptime

 * `inconsistent_slave_chk`

   Enables active to active replication

 * `queue_age_cap`

   Maximum queue age before flushing data

 * `max_checkpoints`

   Maximum number of checkpoints

 * `max_size`

   Max memory used by the server

 * `max_txn_size`

   Maximum number of items in a flusher transaction

 * `mem_high_wat`

   High water mark

 * `mem_low_wat`

   Low water mark

 * `min_data_age`

   Minimum data age before flushing data

 * `sync_cmd_timeout`

   The timeout for the sync command

 * `tap_throttle_queue_cap`

   Destination disk write queue cap for tap backoff ('infinite' means no cap)

 * `tap_throttle_threshold`

   Destination memory threshold for tap backoff

 * `keep_closed_chks`

   Keep all closed checkpoints in memory

 * `flushall_enabled`

   Enable or disable the `flush_all` operation. The `flush_all` operation is
   disabled by default in Couchbase Server 1.8.1. To enable support for the
   `flush_all` operation it must be enabled on each bucket:

    ```
    shell> cbflushctl localhost:11210 set flushall_enabled true sample sample
    ```

   To disable `flush_all` on a given bucket, set `flushall_enabled` to false:

    ```
    shell> cbflushctl localhost:11210 set flushall_enabled false sample sample
    ```

Usage:


```
mbvbucketctl Usage:
mbvbucketctl host:port list [username password] or
mbvbucketctl host:port rm vbid [username password] or
mbvbucketctl host:port set vbid vbstate [username password]
```

<a id="couchbase-admin-cmdline-cbvbuckettool"></a>

## Usingcbvbuckettool

Usage:


```
shell> cbvbuckettool mapfile key0 [key1 ... keyN]
```

The `cbvbuckettool` expects a vBucketServerMap JSON mapfile, and will print the
vBucketId and servers each key should live on. You may use '-' instead for the
filename to specify stdin.

Examples:


```
shell> cbvbuckettool file.json some_key another_key
```

Or


```
shell> curl http://host:8091/pools/default/buckets/default | cbvbuckettool - some_key another_key
```

An example of running it with output:


```
shell> curl http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/buckets/default | cbvbuckettool - some_key another_key
key: some_key vBucketId: 260 master: http://127.0.0.1:11210/ replicas:
key: another_key vBucketId: 1022 master: http://127.0.0.1:11210/ replicas:
