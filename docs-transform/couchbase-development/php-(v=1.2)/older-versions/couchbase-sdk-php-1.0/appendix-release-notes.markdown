## Release Notes for Couchbase Client Library PHP 1.0.5 GA (13 August 2012)

**New Features and Behavior Changes in 1.0.5**

 * Allow for multiple hosts to be specified either via an array or a semicolon
   delimited list

   This feature will configure the client library to automatically select another
   node from the cluster if the first node specified is down.

**Fixes in 1.0.5**

 * PCBC-77: Do not attempt to decompress uncompressed JSON.

   This change allows for interoperability between the Java client library and the
   PHP client library, even though the flags may be slightly different between the
   two.

 * PCBC-75: Correctly free persistent structures.

   Prior to this change, in some cases the client could encounter a segmentation
   fault while trying to use persistent connections.
