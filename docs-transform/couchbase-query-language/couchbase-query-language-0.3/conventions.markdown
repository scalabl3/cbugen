# Conventions

The following typographical conventions are used to mark different parts of the command syntax:

* Upper case indicates keywords. Example, SELECT.
* Single or double quotes surround expressions that are specific query items. Either single or double quotes can be used. Example, fname='Ian' or fname="Bill".
* Square brackets indicate optional parts. Example, [NOT] BETWEEN
* Pipe (single vertical line)  separates alternatives. Example, AND | OR.
* Parentheses indicate functions that perform an operation. Example: COUNT(*).
* Dots mean that the preceding element in a query can be repeated.
