# Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to use Couchbase Lite in your iOS apps. The tutorial assumes you already know how to develop iOS apps and have Xcode 5 or later installed on your computer. 

If you need to learn about iOS programming, a good place to start is by reading Apple's free tutorial, [Start Developing iOS Apps Today](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011343), which provides a hands-on introduction to iOS app development. To access the Apple tutorial, you need to register for a [free Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/register/index.action).

<!--
The tutorial contains several apps that gradually introduce some of the main Couchbase Lite concepts:

* [HelloCBL](#hellocbl) is a basic "Hello World" app designed to introduce the basics of working with Couchbase Lite, without considering the details of structuring an iOS app.
* [LiteNote](#litenote), a notepad app, demonstrates the basic Couchbase Lite APIs  shown in HelloCBL and introduces a few additional APIs in the context of a well-structured iOS app.
* [LiteNoteViews](#litenoteviews) builds on LiteNote to introduce the APIs for working with views and queries.
* [LiteNoteSync](#litenotesync) builds on LiteNoteViews to add synchronization and user authentication.  [Couchbase Cloud](http://www.couchbasecloud.com) provides Couchbase Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server for the back end.

You can [download the Couchbase Lite iOS tutorial apps](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-lite-tutorial-ios) from GitHub.
